# Frontend polish and foreground waiting

Base: upstream main `def4a41adae71465e6ccf3f1492665e93865c272`, containing merged PRs #8/#9; branch `feature/frontend-polish`. Workstream 2 remains independent.

## Changes and interface

Source and rebuilt assets are delivered together. Existing API/session/generation guards and server runtime are retained. The additional `/assets/theme.js` is packaged by existing rules and served through the existing safe same-origin asset route. CSP stays unchanged. Native/development/server policies and detector artifacts are unchanged.

- Home, Replay Lab, How It Works, embedded illustrated Guide and Results.
- Explicit selected 2D/3D controls, pre-run empty 3D, visible WebGL fallback, unchanged completed cursor/selection/history across view/theme switches.
- Light/Dark/System preference before stylesheet paint; semantic CSS, SVG, Canvas and Three.js colors; no theme-triggered job.
- One bounded Canvas hero and SVG packet/attack teaching area; hidden/offscreen/reduced-motion safeguards. Only replay creates WebGL. Playback pauses advancement offscreen.
- Selected-track velocity magnitude chart reads completed observations and configured header time. Units remain provisional; missing values and gaps remain missing. No scores or verdicts inferred.
- Central delayed wait with decorative SVG circuit dragon; minimize/expand/Cancel; stage-only announcements. Counts/denominators come from job progress, queue/cooling from current runtime fields. Elapsed clock measures the foreground operation, not detector CPU. Result retrieval is a separate phase. Evidence uses delayed inline feedback; polling cadence is unchanged. Reset/errors/generation guards prevent stale resurrection.
- Legacy `detector_cpu_seconds` remains unchanged; its UI label describes the recorded wall interval accurately.

## Targeted validation

`npm ci --no-audit --no-fund`, `npm run build`, `npm run test:polish` (two unit checks and targeted synthetic browser fixtures under production CSP). Fixtures cover mobile/desktop, themes/persistence/System changes, paused/playing view switches, pre-run selection, WebGL fallback, guide/navigation, illustration pause/step/reduced motion, central/minimized/result-loading waits and a named artifact error. No detector inference occurs in these fixtures. Reports/screenshots go to ignored `runs/frontend-polish/`.

Candidate is staged on loopback 8766 in `phantomguard-polish-stage`, with absolute read-only mounts from the installed original checkout. Local health/readiness and startup logs passed. Public clean/T1-A2 replays and cancel/reset stale-response smoke passed; final image identity and evidence are recorded below. Full suites, detector matrices, stress/performance and thermal tests are deferred as requested.

```

Rollback image: `phantomguard-server:release-def4a41-20261005`, ID `sha256:a19b606946aae07f8a1e76213a2405a24f2ce66b4142fda378ec3e616e216a17`. Ignored environment files preserve the current absolute mounts and limits. One warm worker, 0.25 logical CPU, 2 GiB memory/no extra swap, queue 2, cooldown 5 s (user-requested change; rollback retains 30 s), numerical threads 1, PIDs 64. Tunnel `rikon-home` remains on private `127.0.0.1:8765`; no Cloudflare or unrelated service changes.

Original bundle rechecked SHA-256: `849dbd5c12410e75fd4d1ffc43aee45a7380756639548ac7d921dd7a65f90ad3`. Installed timeblock model ID `2ad682efc017e2cf96d856772b20db898edd6c1e253947b3df013a671f067115`; baseline SHA-256 `b7f592bad60c25bfa4825c528cbb69d05b76239a5d2f500b755d41c933f82faf`. No training/calibration/baseline generation occurred. Historical clean false alerts and eligible attack misses remain visible.

## Executed public release — 2026-10-05 UTC

Live: https://demo.rikon-karmakar.quest/ . Deployed source/config commit
`60eeadf537bbf1b2699dce00f60ac9779ab587a8` (frontend implementation
`487d03c0241eda93158023a7f054d28cd3540c4c`, then server cooldown change).
Image `phantomguard-server:frontend-polish-60eeadf-20261005`, Docker ID
`sha256:70e2d14ebb424bb29fb68f909e652c36b788b8d45666b212277988ff5d51426e`.
Revision label equals the deployed source. Later delivery commits contain only
handoff/PR descriptions/screenshots and do not change serving code or config.

The exact image first passed health/readiness/startup logs on loopback 8766;
packaged frontend assets, pre-run WebGL and theme were checked there. Promotion
recreated only `phantomguard-server`'s prototype. The staging container is stopped;
its private volume/network and all retained images remain available. Local and
public readiness return 200/ok, container healthy, automatic restart count zero,
no OOM. Actual live environment has cooldown **5**, worker/warm-worker **1**, queue
**2**, OPENBLAS/OMP/MKL **1**; cgroup limits remain CPU **2500/10000**, memory/swap
**2147483648 bytes**, PIDs **64**, loopback **127.0.0.1:8765**. Effective merged
container development configuration independently shows cooldown **0**, adjustable
four CPUs and no fractional quota. This is a configuration change, not a measured
algorithm speedup or a thermal claim.

Essential public Chromium checks passed:

- One newly computed clean and one supported T1/A2 moving replay, each 150 cycles,
  `onePersonMovingFrontAndBack.csv`, seed 11, with original model/baseline identities
  and private `Cache-Control: no-store` results. They were reused for all completed
  playback, chart, theme and view checks; no additional inference was submitted by
  presentation controls.
- Selected 3D before a run and after reset; synchronized controls/label/renderer;
  paused and playing 2D/3D switches retained object selection and cursor/history.
  Themes changed the current result presentation without another job.
- Real central/minimized waiting, guide access, completion removing both panels,
  desktop/mobile light/dark layouts and reduced-motion/manual teaching controls.
- One further bounded 50-cycle request for Cancel/Reset: a real in-flight status
  response was held and replaced with a delayed 404 fixture after successful DELETE.
  The old response neither replaced the cancellation/reset message nor reopened the
  loader; owner status returned 404 and Run became available. No extra completed
  detector replay was required.
- Root, app.js, style.css and assets/theme.js all returned 200. No fatal page errors.
  WebGL fallback, storage/System theme changes, result-retrieval phase and a named
  missing-artifact error were also covered by lightweight synthetic UI fixtures
  under the unchanged production CSP. Those fixtures are not detector results.

Raw evidence: ignored `runs/frontend-polish/{fixture-checks.json,public-smoke.json,
public-clean-result.json,public-T1-result.json,deployment.json,*-ready*.json,
*compose-effective.json,development-effective.json}`. No credentials/session
bearer tokens are saved. Full suites, detector accuracy/attack matrices, broad
session/browser tests, stress/performance benchmarks and thermal tests remain
explicitly deferred until Workstream 2 finishes. Existing reported false-alert and
attack-miss limitations remain visible. No compatible artifact upload is needed.

Before images capture the old full page; after images capture the landing viewport.
The actual dragon is decorative and omitted from assistive output. The screenshots
show real waiting states, not precomputed detector outcomes.

The local builder used its pinned base/dependencies and no learned-artifact commands.
A subsequent build from documentation-only delivery HEAD has the same serving inputs;
the deployed image/revision above is retained precisely for reproducibility.
