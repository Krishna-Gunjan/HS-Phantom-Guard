# Workstream 1 runtime and deployment handoff

Common anchor: 3813b51d0669a4f702638d906cf456034ca8f16a. Runtime source tested in the staged image: 9dd938cbde46343c1c0ac942006ebe2f112bbed4. Branch: feature/server-performance in the Aurora-source fork. No detector, planner, learned feature/config, trained artifact or browser source changes are included. The original archive and all dataset originals are preserved.

The interface contract is [interface-runtime.md](interface-runtime.md); portable resource selection and desktop benchmark requests are in [../runtime-policy.md](../runtime-policy.md). The full original deployment report remains in [../server-validation.md](../server-validation.md), with an appended measured runtime experiment. Raw timestamped evidence is ignored under runs/server-performance/20261005.

Job admission/readiness now uses trusted read-only file metadata and periodic content verification. Missing/replaced artifacts invalidate success; changed configuration requires restart. The server selects one warm spawned worker, bounded immutable recording/pool retention, 16-job/384-MiB worker recycling, cancellation/deadline termination and idle TTL. Each job creates new model instances, Detector/history, attacker/RNG, frame/output lists and labels. Full segment attack planning/materialization is retained. The temporary adapter freezes the existing private pool cache; Workstream 2 should replace it with its public versioned preparation API. No learned/statistical artifact is generated on this server.

Existing endpoints and evidence remain compatible. Optional progress stages and correct process CPU timings supplement legacy wall-clock fields. The completed result stays private bytes. Safe same-origin /assets paths are packaged under web/static/assets for Workstream 3; CSP and private no-store headers are retained. No optional attacker ground-truth API is added.

Relevant validation: 13 runtime tests and 21 existing browser/backend tests passed with restored artifacts. Native doctor --full passed all five model/baseline sets. The local Chromium check passed independent sessions, cancellation/reset, playback/seek, unsupported choices and private responses. Native Linux default policy tests confirm no server quota/cooldown/numerical caps are silently selected; Windows hardware/concurrency benchmarking remains for Workstream 2.

Later integration must fetch completed Workstream 2/3 commits and handoffs into a separate feature/prototype-integration worktree and merge normally. No Workstream 2/3 branches have been integrated here. Keep the original artifact bundle until a new compatible tested bundle is explicitly supplied. Missing/new artifacts block only deployment of that detector version.

The deployed service uses the existing production Compose project phantomguard-server, private localhost port 8765, existing application runs volume/network and unchanged host-running rikon-home tunnel route. Staging used its own project/8766 and is stopped after promotion. Current local/public readiness returned HTTP 200 with runtime identity abdeb69002b69b4fd1a0d1e0257fd6b2bc6cc3f648834dd4624911786e686046. The image is phantomguard-server:performance-9dd938c, Docker ID sha256:fba909d2252e5aff4bbb3f38c357afe7210ffca1d57bafa4d36fa88ac4efca83.

At identical quota/rest, five fixed jobs used 109.106 versus 45.752 measured cgroup core-seconds (2.38× reduction). Warm T1 active wall dropped from about 88 to 14.02 seconds; T2–T4 from about 88–99 to 17.5–23.4 seconds. First cold T1 still prepares pools (61.64 seconds planning, 104.70 end-to-end). Eleven final staged jobs completed with no failures/timeouts. Exact non-timing detector outputs and five full-stream/EOF-label/lifecycle hashes matched, including a new T1 seed. Peak app RAM fell from 320 to 287 MiB; warm idle retains 140.5 versus 123 MiB before. The final full benchmark kept the three-minute temperature mean below 80°C. All fixed requests keep full attack planning and detector frames.

Operational commands (each wrapper explicitly selects both Compose files and project/env):

```bash
APP=/home/lucifer/projects/Hacksprint-2026/phantom-guard-server-performance
export PHANTOMGUARD_COMPOSE_PROJECT=phantomguard-server
export PHANTOMGUARD_SERVER_ENV="$APP/.env.promote"
"$APP/scripts/server-compose" config
"$APP/scripts/server-compose" up -d --no-build prototype
"$APP/scripts/server-compose" ps
"$APP/scripts/server-compose" logs --tail 100 prototype
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8765/readyz
curl -fsS https://demo.rikon-karmakar.quest/readyz
"$APP/scripts/server-compose" restart prototype
"$APP/scripts/server-compose" stop prototype
```

For an update, fetch the completed reviewed branch into this worktree, retain the prior source/image and env, build with the staged env/project/8766, repeat the documented fixed checks, then point .env.promote to that verified image and use the commands above. Never restore a new bundle at a mismatched source or manufacture artifacts on the server.

Rollback to retained thermal-tuned image with the same absolute artifact mounts and limits:

```bash
env PHANTOMGUARD_SERVER_ENV="$APP/.env.promote.rollback" PHANTOMGUARD_COMPOSE_PROJECT=phantomguard-server "$APP/scripts/server-compose" config
env PHANTOMGUARD_SERVER_ENV="$APP/.env.promote.rollback" PHANTOMGUARD_COMPOSE_PROJECT=phantomguard-server "$APP/scripts/server-compose" up -d --no-build prototype
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8765/readyz
```

Original rollback images, dataset originals, model sets and archive remain present. The bundle checksum is 849dbd5c12410e75fd4d1ffc43aee45a7380756639548ac7d921dd7a65f90ad3; serving model ID is 2ad682efc017e2cf96d856772b20db898edd6c1e253947b3df013a671f067115, baseline SHA b7f592bad60c25bfa4825c528cbb69d05b76239a5d2f500b755d41c933f82faf. No new bundle is required for this runtime-only release. Existing false-alert/attack-evasion limitations remain unchanged and visible.

Public Chromium repeat passed all five grouped checks and 94 no-store/DYNAMIC private responses, with no page errors. The first attempt caught the frontend reset/poll message race; its required Workstream 3 fix is documented in interface-runtime.md. Cancellation/session ownership and replay work correctly, but the intermittent display race remains open.

Fork branch published successfully with an identical checked Git tree. Upstream PR creation was blocked by GitHub integration HTTP 403 (Resource not accessible by integration); no PR exists. Exact title/body and the compare/create URL are saved in server-pr.md. Deployment remains running.

Post-restart local/public readiness and fresh public Chromium clean/T1-A2 150-cycle replay/stepping passed with zero page errors. Only Phantom Guard was restarted; unrelated services/tunnel routes remain intact.

Real idle cleanup also passed: a 51-byte interrupted-check status directory expired automatically at the configured 600 s TTL; the application browser output directory returned to zero files/bytes. Final idle core/package temperature was 66°C, no swap-out, with about 6.55 GiB RAM available. Numerical replay children remained single-threaded and only the intentional warm worker was retained.
