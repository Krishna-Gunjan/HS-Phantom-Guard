# Phantom-Guard offline prototype: plan

## Current extension: portable hosted prototype

PR #4's Phases 0–6 implementation is accepted on upstream main at `89b182f`.
The owner now authorizes a CPU browser around recorded data/simulated CAN attacks,
portable fresh-clone setup, shared paths/doctor, pinned runtime/container, real
Windows/Linux validation and a checksummed private data/artifact handoff bundle.
Implementation is in `feature/portable-hosted-prototype`, preserving prior histories.
No detector operating point changes are authorized by new held-out measurements.
The existing under-one false-alert target is still an explicitly failing criterion.
Final executed extension status is appended after validation; see README and
docs/setup.md, data.md, pipeline.md, deployment.md and server-handoff.md.

## Context
The repo contains only `SPEC.md` (the spec), `tools/decode.py` (decoder v2) and the four recorded CSVs. The
task is to build the offline prototype that SPEC.md describes (frame layer, replay source, baseline, attacker,
detector layers 1-5, evaluation and viewer) under its hard rules: causal only, no label leakage, attacker sampled
from real distributions, thresholds learned from data, test split never used for tuning. After approval, the first
step is to write this plan into `docs/plan.md`. The repo has no python deps yet; PyPI is reachable; 4 CPUs, 15 GB RAM.

## What I checked before planning (stdlib, read-only, all four files)
Matches SPEC.md: raw_len is always 8; header count == actual count; meas_counter steps by +1 everywhere and is
continuous across files; sync_status is always 0x01; dyn_prop is always 0; the reserved bits (b6 bits 4-3) are
always 0; `tools/decode.decode_object(raw_hex)` reproduces x/y/vx/vy/rcs in the CSV for **every** row (0
mismatches); median period is 332 ticks (p1-p99 is 328-336); arrival offset is 2-77; slots run 0x00-0x35 and never
repeat within a cycle; moving fraction is 5.0 / 6.7 / 1.6 / 6.3 %; the ghost at (18.6, 6.6) has vx ≈ -4.5 to
-4.75 in every file.

Contradictions and surprises (to go into `docs/plan.md` and `docs/decisions.md`):
1. **The short sync gaps are capture-start artefacts.** In every file they are exactly gaps 0 and 1 (59-193
   ticks). After that the minimum is ≥304 (304 appears only once, in front-back).
2. **meas_counter is not a clock.** Between files `sync_timestamp` jumps 159k-208k ticks (16-21 s at 0.1 ms per
   tick) while meas_counter advances by exactly 1. Hypothesis: with no node ACKing on the bus, the sensor stops
   making progress (CAN retransmits the pending frame). When capture resumes, its queued frames flush, which
   explains finding 1. Consequence: the cadence rule must ignore the first 2 gaps after a stream starts (a
   "warm-up" rule taken from data), and counter continuity must be checked separately from timing.
3. "The first cycle of a file may lack a full header" is **false** for these files: every cycle 1 has a full
   header. The handling stays in the code anyway and the count is reported.
4. Slot reassignments (jump > 1.0): emptyRoom has **12**, while SPEC.md says "at most 11". Minor; reported.
5. The `source_file` column is `"live"` in every row. ReplaySource will take the label from the file name instead.
6. `data/raw/` is tracked in git, but SPEC.md says it is gitignored. **Decision: untrack it**
   (`git rm --cached`, files stay on disk untouched, add `data/raw/` and `data/processed/` to `.gitignore`).
7. Only 41-49% of rows fall inside the default ROI (range ≤ 15). Both ghosts are outside it (ranges ≈ 19.7 and
   ≈ 37), so the ROI handles them as SPEC.md intends.
8. T4 overwrite conflicts with "no deletion of real frames". **Decision: level-dependent.** A0/A1 send the
   forged frame alongside the real one with the same slot. A2+ replace the real frame in place, which is the same
   strong capability as A2 header forging. Logged as a deliberate worst-case assumption.
9. To verify in Phase 1: whether vy is ever meaningfully non-zero (the sensor may report only radial/Doppler
   velocity, which matches the side-to-side note); whether RCS only takes integer values (raw always even), in
   which case the attacker must match it; and RCS vs range.

## Cross-cutting design decisions
- **Package**: src layout, `pyproject.toml` (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, torch CPU, matplotlib, pyyaml; dev:
  pytest). Torch is installed from the CPU wheel index (`--index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`). If
  that index is blocked, I fall back to PyPI and report it.
- **Reusing the decoder**: `frames.decode_object` loads `tools/decode.py` with `importlib` (by path) and calls its
  `decode_object`, so the formulas are not forked. `encode_object` is the exact inverse, using the scale/offset
  table in `frames.py`. A test checks `decode(encode(decode(raw)))` and the byte equality of
  `encode(decode(raw))` on all 442,724 rows.
- **Cycle assembly** (`detect/pipeline.py`): frames come in, and a cycle closes when the next 0x60A arrives (this
  is causal and adds one cycle of latency, documented). Detector state is per slot. Every frame gets a
  `frame_index` (its position in the stream). Verdicts are emitted per frame_index, and only the evaluator joins
  them with the labels file.
- **Config**: `configs/default.yaml` holds ROI, zones, tick_seconds=1e-4 (flagged as an assumption), window sizes,
  M-of-N 3/5, seeds, moving threshold 0.30, split fractions, and attack parameter ranges from SPEC.md (lifetimes,
  counts). `configs/baseline.json` is generated, and every entry is `{value, rule, split, fp_rate_val}`.
- **Splits** (`eval/splits.py`): per-file contiguous cycle blocks 60/20/20, plus LOSO (4 folds). Baseline and
  learned thresholds use train (and validation for calibration). Test is used only by `run_attack_eval.py`.
- **ROI**: the protocol layer checks every frame. The kinematic, replay and AE layers judge only objects inside
  the ROI; objects outside it are counted and reported as "out-of-ROI", never flagged. The attacker places
  T1/T2 objects inside the ROI.

## Phases (pytest, commit and push after each, plus a short summary printed each time)

**Phase 0: scaffold + frames.** Layout from SPEC.md, `pyproject.toml`, `.gitignore`, `configs/default.yaml`,
`docs/plan.md`, `docs/decisions.md`; untrack data/raw. `frames.py`: `Frame(can_id, data, timestamp_ticks)`,
`RadarObject` dataclass, `decode_object`, `encode_object`, `build_header(count, meas_counter, status)` (byte3 =
0x00), `parse_header`. Tests: all-rows round trip, CSV columns vs decoder, header round trip, and a report of any
byte differences (the reserved bits are expected to be the only possible source).

**Phase 1: sources + baseline.** `io/source.py` (`FrameSource` protocol), `io/replay.py` (`ReplaySource(csv,
cycle_range=None)`, which rebuilds headers and reports malformed/short/first-cycle counts), `io/live.py` stub.
`stats/tracks.py`: per-slot track linking with reassignment detection (jump threshold learned from data).
`stats/baseline.py` + `scripts/learn_baseline.py` (train split only): period/jitter with the warm-up rule,
arrival-offset window (p0.1-p99.9 plus margin rule), objects/cycle, distribution of slots taken by new tracks,
speed/acceleration envelopes of moving in-ROI tracks, birth stats (position, initial speed), per-track RCS std,
range-rate vs reported radial velocity residual over a window (so the check survives 0.2 quantisation: 1 m/s ×
33 ms = 0.033 per cycle, so a one-cycle check is meaningless). Prints each value next to the SPEC.md claim and
flags mismatches. RCS-vs-range analysis: overall Spearman correlation plus per-track regression slopes, written
to `docs/results/rcs_vs_range.md`.

**Phase 2: attacker.** `attack/levels.py` (A0-A4 capability flags), `attack/scenarios.py` (T1-T4 generators,
seeded from config), `attack/injector.py` (`AttackedSource(source, attacker, labels_path)`). Everything forged is
built with `encode_object`/`build_header`, and slots, offsets, RCS and speeds come from `baseline.json`. A0:
random times/slots/bytes. A1: offsets inside the window, free slot, header not fixed. A2: rewrites the header
count (forged header labelled). A3: constant-velocity path with consistent velocity fields, RCS sampled per track
with real jitter, and an integer RCS grid if the data has one. A4: T3 replay segments, or T1 paths built from real
recorded moving tracks. T3 sources are reported separately: (a) earlier in the same stream, (b) the training
portion, (c) another file's unseen portion. T4 follows the level-dependent rule above. Tests: A0 fails protocol
checks; A2+ passes them; forged slot range, offsets and RCS fall inside the real ranges (KS-style tests against
train); labels never appear in the frames or the pipeline.

**Phase 3: physics gate.** `detect/protocol.py` (count mismatch, duplicate slot, counter continuity, cadence with
warm-up, arrival offset, length/ID), `detect/kinematic.py` (windowed range-rate vs radial velocity, speed/accel
envelope, implausible birth (scored), RCS stability, co-location), `detect/replay_fp.py` (quantised
translation-invariant displacement+velocity k-gram hashes for moving tracks only, matched against a library from
training plus the stream's own past and concurrent tracks; a minimum-motion-complexity gate stops constant-velocity
real walks from matching). All thresholds come from train, and their FP rate on validation goes into
baseline.json. Clean FP is reported per object-cycle and per minute, then detection by type × level. Latency test:
p99 per cycle < 10 ms on about 25 objects.

**Phase 4: learned layer.** `detect/autoencoder.py`: per-track windows (N from config, default 10) of [dx, dy,
radial v, vx, vy, rcs, range] normalised with training stats; small MLP AE; CPU training with an epoch/time cap in
`scripts/train.py`. Threshold = validation-clean percentile. Isolation-forest baseline on the same windows; report
AUROC for both and keep the better one as the layer. `detect/fusion.py`: hard violations flag immediately,
otherwise M-of-N per track. Both splits evaluated; time-to-detect measured.

**Phase 5: report.** `eval/metrics.py`, `eval/report.py`, `scripts/run_attack_eval.py` (multiprocessing, fixed
seeds, several runs) write CSVs plus `docs/results/summary.md`: the type × level × layer matrix, ablations
(leave-one-layer-out), static vs moving, time-split vs LOSO, alerts/min, time-to-detect, evading levels stated
explicitly, and the deck-claims section (kinematic plausibility, timing signature, RCS-vs-range, AE, "no
labelled attack data").

**Phase 6: viewer.** `viz/console.py` + `scripts/replay_demo.py`: matplotlib (interactive window at about real
time, or headless Agg export), top-down x/y scatter, quiver velocity arrows, green/red with reason codes, alert
log panel. PNG and GIF (PillowWriter) go to `docs/results/`. The choice is logged in decisions.md.

## Verification
- `pytest -q` after every phase (data tests skip if the CSVs are absent; a latency test is included).
- `python scripts/learn_baseline.py`, `python scripts/train.py` and `python scripts/run_attack_eval.py` all run end
  to end. Every number in `docs/results/` is produced by them.
- `python scripts/replay_demo.py --file onePersonMovingFrontAndBack.csv --attack T1 --level A2 --export` produces
  the PNG and GIF.
- Final report: what works, what doesn't, the headline table, and the next 3 steps.

## Post-approval updates
Findings during implementation changed some details (gap bridging in the tracker, learned `rr_scale`, a
range-conditional RCS band, burst-contiguity and range-order protocol checks). Each is logged with its evidence in
`docs/decisions.md`.

## Status (2026-10-03, second round)
- Done: Phases 0-1; detector layers 1-5 (protocol, kinematic, replay fingerprint, autoencoder plus offline isolation
  forest, M-of-N fusion); validation calibration; clean-data evaluation (`scripts/run_clean_eval.py` ->
  `docs/results/clean_eval.md`); latency test; matplotlib viewer with PNG/GIF export.
- Not done: the Phase 2 attacker (only level flags and data pools exist), so there are no attacked-data results,
  no type x level x layer matrix, and no `run_attack_eval.py` / `summary.md`.
- Commands: `python scripts/learn_baseline.py --loso && python scripts/train.py --loso && python scripts/calibrate.py --loso
  && python scripts/run_clean_eval.py && python scripts/replay_demo.py --file onePersonMovingFrontAndBack.csv --export --around-first-alert`

## Status (2026-10-04, isolated Phases 3–6 worktree)

- Worktree: `D:\Hacksprint\phantom-guard-phases-3-6`; branch `feature/phases-3-6`; base
  `7cdfa584edd20c8653991a8fbe8d6023c7b55493`. Original checkout and contributor work are preserved.
- Phase 3 completed/audited: exact two-gap cadence warm-up; protocol malformed/duplicate/counter handling;
  causal malformed-header boundaries; ROI-consistent windowed physics, learned radial scale, birth/colocation,
  replay library/history/concurrent provenance, expiry and simple/static repeat exclusions; lossless frame
  identities and separate CPU/assembly delay. New contradictions are in the dated decisions log.
- Phase 4 completed/audited: identical offline/online features; training-only normalization; explicit unavailable,
  empty/gap/stale artifacts; provenance-checked AE/IF/library; separate static/moving validation thresholds;
  fixed AE deployment selection; equivalent captured windows for offline IF; missing-scan persistence and one
  vote per track per scan. No attack/test-driven threshold/model selection.
- Phase 5 implemented: `eval/report.py`, `eval/attack_adapter.py`, `scripts/run_attack_eval.py`, compatible
  lossless metrics; exact label joins, cycle versus forged-object outcomes, censoring, AUROC, per-layer/ablation,
  clean object/episode rates, CPU p99 budget and assembly delay. Reports/configurations/provenance are generated.
  Real attack performance remains blocked because upstream Phase 2 scenario/injector code is absent; fixture
  verification is explicitly not an attacker benchmark. See `docs/phase2-handoff.md` for the exact adapter API.
- Phase 6 completed: clean replay and optional attacked FrameSource, `--attack/--level/--seed/--provider`,
  strict artifact/argument/empty checks, detector-only colors/reasons/velocity/logs, headless PNG/GIF exports
  and distinct names. Green means “not flagged.” Real attacked exports require Phase 2.
- Raw data recovered read-only from initial Git blobs into this worktree; preparation ran in the prescribed
  baseline -> train -> calibrate order for all five splits. Fresh evaluation outcomes and executed validation
  are recorded in generated `docs/results/summary.md` and the final handoff; historical results remain disclosed.
- This assignment's latest user instruction authorizes pushing the new branch after local commits. No merge
  into main, deployment or contributor messaging is authorized or performed.
- Final checks: 109 tests passed with no skips; generated JUnit report `docs/results/validation.xml`.
  All four recordings match their original Git blobs and remain read-only. Baseline/train/calibrate/clean eval
  completed for time-block and all LOSO folds. Final attack matrix is explicitly blocked/unsupported, with
  eight clean segments measured; real attacked-data validation and exports await Phase 2.
- Generated outputs: `docs/results/summary.md`, `attack_eval_*.csv`, `attack_eval_manifest.json`, fresh
  `clean_eval*` reports, and front/back/chaotic `demo_*_test_clean` PNG/GIF/alert CSVs. Both real clean GIFs
  contain 75 frames. Final diff has no attacker changes or original-checkout changes.
## Status (2026-10-04, third round): Phase 2 complete
- Added: synthetic fabricated-frame generator (`attack/scenarios.py`, `attack/injector.py`), the
  attack evaluation (`scripts/run_attack_eval.py` -> `docs/results/summary.md` + attack_*.csv), the
  `COUNT_RANGE` protocol check, viewer `--attack/--level` with ground-truth rings, attacked PNG/GIF demos.
- All phases (0-6) now have code and generated results. 44 tests pass.
- Full regeneration order: `learn_baseline.py --loso` -> `train.py --loso` -> `calibrate.py --loso`
  -> `run_clean_eval.py` -> `run_attack_eval.py`
  -> `replay_demo.py --file onePersonMovingFrontAndBack.csv --attack T1 --level A3 --export`

## Status (2026-10-04, fourth round): enhancement #1 (clean false alarms)
- Autoencoder made corroborating-only; fusion M/N chosen on clean validation (`fusion_mn`, 4/6 time-block).
- Clean test 4.73 -> 1.42 alerts/min, LOSO 5.87 -> 3.98; detection cost 2-6 points at A2-A4. Target < 1/min still not met.
- Attack eval made reproducible (seed bug); both evals now report the previous operating point like-for-like.

## Final status (2026-10-04, complete workflow in the existing feature worktree)

This section supersedes earlier availability/status snapshots, which remain as history.

- Worktree `D:\Hacksprint\phantom-guard-phases-3-6`, branch `feature/phases-3-6`, original
  base `7cdfa584edd20c8653991a8fbe8d6023c7b55493`. Merged accepted upstream main
  `1f5d2eea3d9bc8343666fb20025ea6fdf2d0d3da` with both histories preserved. The three
  new accepted commits supply Phase 2 and validation-based fusion; contributor
  branches and the original checkout remain untouched.
- **Phase 0:** reused accepted scaffold/decoder/byte-exact object round trips; bounded
  classic CAN headers at eight bytes while preserving unknown reconstructed DLC.
- **Phase 1:** reused ingestion/tracking and regenerated all training baselines,
  including learned median cadence and `rr_scale`. All four supplied source CSVs and
  read-only raw copies match the archived SHA256 inventory.
- **Phase 2:** integrated accepted planners/injector through `AttackedSource` and
  ordinary frames. Complete final-index labels include forged headers. Lifecycle
  metadata, generic-source buffering, level-dependent T4, stable-slot handling,
  gap-separated scheduling, serialized bus timing, real pools, and explicit replay
  provenance are implemented and tested. A2 remains unaware of range order and
  burst contiguity; A3+ implements them. See `docs/phase2-handoff.md`.
- **Phase 3:** causal cycle verdicts, exact two-gap warm-up, malformed/duplicate/
  missing-header/counter rollover checks; ROI-consistent windowed physics, track gaps
  and reassignment; training/history/concurrent translation-invariant replay gates.
- **Phase 4:** clean CPU AE training/NumPy inference, equivalent-window IF comparison,
  training-only normalization, split/scenario resets, separate static/moving
  calibration, strict artifact provenance, explicit unavailable outcomes, hard
  immediate alerts and calibrated soft persistence. Fixed AE deployment selection;
  no new held-out model or threshold selection. The accepted corroborating AE policy
  adds no incremental boolean alerts; raw-score comparisons remain reported.
- **Phase 5:** full real-data evaluation finished with seeds 11/22/33, three repetitions,
  fixed time blocks and all four LOSO folds, every layer and ablation, static/moving
  and replay source/translation cases. Of 2,664 supported attempts, 2,411 emitted
  eligible attacks, 198 had no eligible source material, and 55 exhausted slot
  capacity. T3/A0–A2 adds 1,296 explicit unsupported requests. No integration blocker;
  no fixture headline metrics. All per-run/instance, matrix/layer, clean/exclusion,
  provenance, AUROC, delay and latency evidence is programmatically generated.
- **Phase 6:** actual clean and attacked CLI paths work. Four PNG/GIF pairs and alert
  logs were regenerated (front/back clean and T1/A2; chaotic clean and T1/A3).
  Every GIF has 75 frames at 840×378. Real Tk clean/attacked event loops passed an
  automated window-closure smoke check; no human usability review is claimed.
  Viewer colors remain detector-only and green means not flagged.
- **Executed validation:** preparation ran in baseline -> train -> calibrate ->
  clean eval -> attack eval order; all five trained/calibrated artifact bundles are
  compatible. Full pytest: **139 passed, zero skipped**, JUnit archived. Compileall,
  pip dependency check, diff whitespace review, source checksum/local import checks,
  viewer exports and real Tk checks passed.
- **Performance acceptance:** clean false alerts are **1.42/min time-block** and
  **3.41/min LOSO**, so the under-1 target remains **NOT MET**. Single-worker clean
  processing p99 is 1.52 ms; worst completed attacked-run p99 is 5.76 ms, with no
  completed run over the 10 ms budget. Capture assembly p99 is separately 33.5–33.6 ms
  under the configured, unverified tick duration. Eighteen observed runs completely
  evade scene detection. The generated summary retains misses and differentiates
  scene alarms from forged-object identification.
- **Remaining limits:** static phantoms and complex genuine repeated motion,
  cross-scenario envelope generalization, unavailable moving clips/slot capacity,
  assumed coordinate/tick/header layout, and lack of live hardware verification.
  No missing Phase 2 interface dependency remains. Historical test inspection is
  still disclosed; remaining false positives did not drive new threshold tuning.
- Publication is to the verified `Aurora-source/phantom-guard` fork, followed by a
  cross-fork PR to `Krishna-Gunjan/phantom-guard:main`. This replaces the old
  push-after-each-phase/main-publication instructions for the current assignment.

## Final extension status (2026-10-05)

- Accepted Phases 0-6 remain implemented: decoder/source/baseline and real attacker
  integration; causal protocol/physics/replay; CPU AE, offline IF and validation
  fusion; full clean/attack/layer/ablation reporting; real matplotlib replay. No
  attacker contract dependency remains. The under-one clean FP criterion is failing.
- Added installed CPU CLI, a canonical immutable/raw-processed-model-runs layout,
  shared anchored configuration, directory initialization/import/checksums, doctor,
  pinned runtime/offline/training locks and explicit Python 3.11 support. Decoder
  and commands live in the package; compatibility wrappers retain their interfaces.
- Added bounded isolated browser/API jobs using real test replay and accepted
  attacks, actual published evaluation data, detector colors/reasons/velocity/logs,
  reset/cancellation and immutable playback seeks. Ground truth never affects it.
  Linux deployment uses a pinned nonroot/read-only container and dedicated outputs.
- Latest accepted main `f93f283` is merged. Its artifact IDs were unavailable
  locally, so matching baselines/models/calibration were prepared offline using
  fixed training/validation segments. Full matrix source is `e530d8f`: 2,411
  eligible runs, 198 no-material attempts, 55 capacity exclusions, 1,296 unsupported
  requests and no integration blockers. Earlier sweeps remain in Git history.
  Windows and Ubuntu 26.04.1 WSL normal-wheel tests, real exports, browser/API
  and container checks pass; executed counts and final checks are in the evidence.
- Fresh generated results and portability evidence are under docs/results/portable
  and portable_validation.json. Fresh clean FP is 1.42/3.41 per minute; eighteen
  evading completed runs remain reported. Worst attacked processing p99 is 8.55 ms,
  idle single-worker clean p99 is 1.97 ms; assembly p99 is separately 33.5–33.6 ms.
  The under-one false-alert acceptance criterion still fails.
- Final viewer correction anchors recording names to configured raw data and
  explicit relative paths to the workspace; caller-directory files cannot override
  either. Targeted regressions cover both the resolver and actual CLI selection.
  Source newline equivalence is recorded separately from original benchmark hashes.
- Private reproducible deployment ZIP, checksums and server handoff are prepared
  locally; final archive verification/restoration and publication status are in the
  handoff/delivery response. Actual home-server deployment is a later assignment.
