the delivery's Windows/WSL timings are not used as server timings.

## Deployment identity and restored inputs

- Ubuntu 26.04 LTS, kernel `7.0.0-28-generic`, HP ProBook 650 G1,
  Intel i5-4200M: **2 physical cores / 4 logical CPUs**; **10.63 GiB RAM**,
  4 GiB swap, about 67 GiB root filesystem space remaining after builds.
- Docker 29.1.3 / Compose 2.40.3. System Python 3.14.4 was preserved.
  Offline verification uses isolated `.venv` Python **3.11.17**, pinned
  `requirements/offline.lock`; serving uses the pinned Debian/Python Dockerfile.
- Initial restored/tested source:
  `c2cc251c6f4cbaf64dc36ad73a0b4d515dbeff79`. Delivery source:
  `69c3b933b26f230912509f95b1a8dfe0e90b7941`. Their changes are only README,
  handoff and bundle-validation documentation; implementation/dependencies match.
- Runtime implementation commit: **`aefe8ac223d6d87cf9ecebc245407a89720866eb`**,
  branch `feature/server-deployment-tuning`; subsequent report/helper commits do not
  change the running implementation. Installed API/worker hashes match this source.
- Running image: `phantomguard-server:thermal-tuned`, image ID
  `sha256:ea980f8c541d0ee381729e0c574b67ae34d2a65ce0f89f5c3b5d03acc0d393fb`.
  Original image retained as `phantomguard-server:c2cc251-before`, ID
  `sha256:f4ce6d3395f2764bca7887017eda5da1cfc07ff624ee1a5acbfbedf972738864`.
- Archive `/home/lucifer/projects/Hacksprint-2026/phantomguard-c2cc251c6f4c.zip`:
  **10,319,138 bytes**, trusted SHA-256
  `849dbd5c12410e75fd4d1ffc43aee45a7380756639548ac7d921dd7a65f90ad3`.
  The sidecar was absent. After directly verifying this trusted digest, a sidecar
  was written because the implemented restore CLI requires it. Provenance checks
  were used normally at the exact tested source; none were bypassed.
- All **54 payload files / 154,599,161 uncompressed bytes** restored and verified;
  15 model/library files across five artifact tags, calibrated baselines and
  preprocessing contracts passed `doctor --full`. Final rehash found all 54
  unchanged. No training, recalibration, baseline rebuilding or full sweep ran.
- Application root: `/home/lucifer/projects/Hacksprint-2026/phantom-guard`.
  Inputs `data/raw`, `models`, `data/processed`, `configs`, `docs/results` are
  mounted read-only. The four raw CSV hashes match the existing `../dataset`
  originals, which were left untouched. Runtime output is the separate Docker
  volume `phantomguard-server_phantomguard-runs`, mounted at `/workspace/runs`.
- Browser AE artifact ID:
  `2ad682efc017e2cf96d856772b20db898edd6c1e253947b3df013a671f067115`;

  `b7f592bad60c25bfa4825c528cbb69d05b76239a5d2f500b755d41c933f82faf`.
- Upstream PR #6 was verified **merged** on 2026-10-04 at 20:13:38 UTC,
  merge commit `d836269d4d70433c20db35a524dc908c9dbf9f38`.

## Effective limits and measured thermal decision

Every operation uses `scripts/server-compose`: project `phantomguard-server`,
both `compose.yaml` and `compose.server.yaml`, ignored `.env.server`. No other
container/service was stopped, pruned, reconfigured or restarted to make room.

| Setting | Effective value |
| --- | --- |
| Worker concurrency | 1 spawned replay process |
| CPU | `cpu.max = 2500 10000`: **0.25 logical CPU**, at most 6.25% of this 4-CPU host |
| Memory / swap | 2 GiB ceiling; container swap disabled; 262 MiB workload peak, 285 MiB including browser verification |
| Queue / retention | 2 waiting jobs, 6 retained jobs, 16 sessions |
| Clips / deadline | 1,200 cycles maximum; 150 s worker deadline; 300 s queue expiry |
| Cooling | 30 s rest after a worker finishes or is cancelled |
| Cleanup / output | 600 s idle/retention TTL; 30 s orphan sweep; 64 MiB output admission threshold |
| Processes / numerical threads | 64 PIDs; OpenBLAS/OMP/MKL each 1 thread |
| Backend | `127.0.0.1:8765` only, read-only root, UID 10001, dropped capabilities |
| Logs / temporary files | json-file 5 MiB × 2; `/tmp` tmpfs 64 MiB |

The output admission threshold bounds accepted storage use; it is **not** a
filesystem hard quota. Numerical thread caps and build-context exclusions already
existed in the delivered Dockerfile; the server override makes caps explicit.
Worker observations showed one numerical thread, with about 12 idle container
threads/PIDs, up to 16 during the workload and 20 during concurrent browser/health verification commands.

Initial one-worker, **1 logical CPU / 2 GiB** deployment had ample RAM but reached
93°C during the early thermal check. A 0.35 CPU trial was stopped at 90°C using
the then-conservative spike guard. The owner's clarified policy permits short
90–95°C spikes and requires sustained temperatures below 75–80°C. The final
measurement guard stopped only benchmark jobs if a sample reached 95°C, a
three-minute mean exceeded 80°C, available RAM fell below 2 GiB, swap writes
exceeded 10 MiB/s, or a new host OOM occurred. A 0.25 CPU trial without rest
still crossed an 80°C three-minute mean and was stopped. Adding the 30 s rest
completed all stages: final one-client three-minute mean peaked at **79.81°C**,
instantaneous maximum **89°C**; two-client maximum 80°C; recovery 67–76°C.
This is a bounded, approximately 18-minute workload, not a 24-hour thermal
guarantee under different ambient temperatures or unrelated future workloads.

## Sampling and reproducible load

Ignored evidence directory:
`runs/server-validation/20261004T204200Z/`. `measurement-summary.json` contains
sample counts/statistics (**1,938 total samples**); raw `host-sampling/samples.jsonl` retains `/proc`, disk,
PSI, temperatures, cgroups, processes, service probes and output observations.
Collection ran in a separate responsive background tool session. The initial collector ended at 23:15 UTC; final public checks resumed collection at 03:05 UTC on October 5. No measurements are claimed across that gap. The local-browser stage label continued into additional idle observation after its check, so its aggregate is not a busy-browser benchmark. No monitoring
stack was installed. CPU thermal-throttle counters were recorded and did not increase after temperature sampling began. Cgroup memory PSI stayed zero during the final load; CPU pressure/throttling from the quota is retained in raw data. Samples were approximately **5 s apart**, with Docker PID
discovery/output scans about every 20 s. Five unavailable cgroup observations
during application recreation are omitted from container statistics.

CPU units: host CPU is percentage of all **four** logical CPUs, excluding
I/O wait (reported separately). Docker/cgroup CPU uses **100% = one logical CPU**;
divide by four for its whole-host share. Memory is actual cgroup usage/peak, not
the 2 GiB limit. `memory.peak` is lifetime high water for that container, not a
new peak per stage. Physical disk counters avoid double-counting LVM devices.
Initial temperature sampling began after the first load run; no initial idle
temperature baseline is claimed.

The canonical requests, chosen from `/api/catalog`, were repeated before/after:

| Case | Recording | Cycles / seed | Attack |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clean | onePersonMovingFrontAndBack.csv | 600 / 11 | none |
| T1 | onePersonMovingFrontAndBack.csv | 600 / 11 | T1/A2 |
| T2 | multiplePeopleChaotic.csv | 600 / 22 | T2/A4 |
| T3 | multiplePeopleChaotic.csv | 1,000 / 11 | T3/A4 translated moving |
| T4 | onePersonMovingSideToSide.csv | 900 / 33 | T4/A4 moving |

Final stages: idle 150 s / 31 samples (includes a harmless controller retry);
one client 533 s / 108 samples; two clients 164 s / 34 samples; four-client burst
195 s / 40 samples; recovery 125 s / 26 samples. Original idle 115 s / 24 samples,
one client 125 s / 26 samples, two clients 149 s / 31 samples; original burst was
thermally interrupted. Single/two-client request sequences are identical.
The final burst controller explicitly starts the expensive worker, queues clients,
checks overload/conflict, cancels all owned jobs, and finishes a fresh clean reset;
the initial burst controller differed, so those burst timings are not a matched
performance comparison. API polling cadence is recorded in workload files.

Final workload: **9 completed jobs, zero failed/timed-out jobs**, 6 deliberate
cancellations, 6 expected HTTP 429 queue rejections and 2 expected 409 duplicate
session submissions. Expected 404s include ownership probes and authenticated
heartbeat probes against a nonexistent job. Final recovery had zero output files
and zero managed job directories; readiness remained healthy, with no automatic
application restarts or new host/container OOMs. One worker with two queued jobs
is the tested operating capacity; four simultaneous clients receive bounded
queue rejections. This is not four-worker support.

### Before/after measurements

| Metric | Initial 1 CPU | Final 0.25 CPU + rest |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Idle host CPU mean | 20.49% (24 samples) | 17.05% (31) |
| Idle app CPU mean, one-core units | 2.17% | 3.11% |
| Busy one-client host CPU mean | 46.37% (26) | 22.22% (108) |
| Busy one-client app CPU mean, one-core units | 94.10% | 20.08% |
| Busy sampled/lifetime peak RAM | 252 / 287 MiB | 235 / 259 MiB |
| Peak RAM including two-client stage | 313 MiB | 262 MiB |
| Minimum available host RAM, one-client | 6.74 GiB | 6.76 GiB |
| Host swap written, one-client stage | 4.24 MiB | 0 MiB |
| Clean submission→completion, first case | 5.72 s | 24.85 s |
| T1–T4 submission→completion, first cases | 17.8–20.8 s | 121.3–131.3 s |
| Observed queue, first clean / following attacks | 0.69 s / 0.22–0.71 s | 2.6 s / 29–30 s cooling |
| Two-client clean / T1 completion | 5.5 / 24.3 s | 50.7 / 170.4 s |
| Job status GET median / maximum | 2.05 / 55.57 ms (730) | 7.20 / 39.55 ms (912) |
| Result GET median / maximum | 308 / 1,066 ms (17) | 126 / 204 ms (9) |
| Three-minute temperature mean / spike | initial mean unmeasured; 93°C spot | maximum 79.81 / 89°C |
| Existing Jellyfin probe timeouts, one/two stages | 2 | 0 |

Idle CPU did not improve: cold report/readiness work and the smaller quota are
visible. Warm recovery memory remained about 92 MiB; it did not return to the
initial cold 40 MiB, while child workers/output were reclaimed. Existing host
swap was already about 1,854 MiB; final roughly 1,959 MiB reflects intervening
host activity and page-ins: 221 MiB was written during an earlier thermal-cooldown
stage, with other smaller writes, before the final trial.
The final load itself wrote **zero** swap and Phantom Guard's cgroup swap stayed
zero. Do not interpret the higher total as application memory pressure.

Original one-client host I/O-wait averaged 34.68%; final 1.27%. Physical disk
read/write means were 5.34/1.35 MiB/s initially and 0.038/0.180 MiB/s finally.
Other workloads changed (e.g. Jellyfin memory/CPU), and later reads were warm,
so differences in whole-host utilization/I/O are observational, not isolated
causal effects of the patch. The directly enforced application CPU reduction,
unchanged outputs and reduced result handling are stronger evidence.

Existing services were sampled on the same schedule. Baseline/final one-client
mean local probe times (ms): Jellyfin 10.01→2.89, Stoat 40.45→5.47,
Sonarr 5.61→3.78, Prowlarr 26.36→2.93, nginx 1.30→1.06. Their expected HTTP
codes were preserved throughout the final workload; portfolio returned its
pre-existing 404. All previously running containers kept their identities and
restart counts; existing healthy checks remained healthy. The already-failed
`smartmontools.service` and historical stopped game containers were preserved.

Cloudflared baseline: **29.36 MiB RSS / 0.27% of one CPU**; final one-client
**29.17 MiB / 0.32%**, two-client **29.29 MiB / 0.34%**. Public browser stage (60 samples): **28.16 MiB RSS / 0.53% of one CPU** on average. Its instantaneous/three-minute temperature maxima were **88°C / 77.75°C**. Browser verification brought the container lifetime memory peak to **285.12 MiB**, below the retained 2 GiB ceiling; 20 PIDs/threads were briefly sampled with concurrent verification commands. Public browser stage statistics are separately retained. These include existing tunnel routes.

### Where job time goes

Final first clean: artifact loading 0.84 s, recording loading 4.56 s,
detect/display 11.30 s, presentation/metrics 0.25 s; worker elapsed 16.95 s,
observed queue 2.58 s, submission→completion 24.85 s. T1: artifact 0.86 s,
data 9.26 s, attacker planning/materialization **61.69 s**, detect/display
15.08 s, presentation 0.19 s; worker elapsed 87.08 s, observed queue 29.21 s,
submission→completion 121.29 s. T2/T3/T4 attacker paths took 68.54/61.05/67.25 s.
The attacker field includes attack data materialization/I/O; it is not pure
planner CPU. Worker elapsed excludes spawn/imports/final result writing;
submission time includes readiness/admission, spawn, queue, worker exit and poll
resolution. Result transfer is measured separately. Observed queue has roughly
one polling interval of uncertainty and includes request admission time.

Assembly **data delay** stayed 33.2 ms median / 33.5–33.6 ms p99. Fields called
`detector_cpu_seconds`/`assembly_cpu_seconds` inherit existing `perf_counter`
timers: they are wall intervals, including descheduling/quota waits, not actual
CPU seconds. Actual CPU is in cgroup `usage_usec`. Final per-cycle combined
processing p99 was 49–81 ms across first cases, so the original 10 ms processing
budget is **not met** on this thermally constrained deployment. Few jobs do not
establish stable tail latency. CPU throttling is expected: about 440 throttled
seconds accumulated in the 533 s one-client stage; no memory/OOM events occurred.

## Changes and correctness evidence

1. Serve the worker's atomic finite `result.json` bytes directly, preserving
   session ownership and `Cache-Control: no-store`; avoid parsing/re-encoding a
   multi-megabyte clip on each fetch. Same-result local CPU profiling: eight
   T3 result responses 5.021 s before, 0.015 s after. This is a focused profile,
   not public network latency. Decoded response content remained identical.
2. Expose bounded queue, storage, retention and cooling settings through CLI/env;
   use the measured server limits above. Keep the 2 GiB memory margin.
3. Poll running jobs every 1 s and queued jobs every 2 s (previously 500 ms).
   Display rendering measured about 1.97 ms/call for a real 1,000-cycle result;
   no detector-frame or evidence simplification was justified or applied.
4. Revisit valid UUID orphan output directories after restart and their TTL.
   Original cleanup checked only at startup, leaving young crash directories
   indefinitely; regression coverage now verifies eventual cleanup.
5. Add phase timing and reproducible measurement/browser scripts and a dedicated
   server Compose wrapper/example. Build was serialized and excluded data/models,
   caches, outputs and credentials using the existing `.dockerignore`.

Detector, data decoder, attack implementation, evaluation, model artifacts,
calibration, configuration and dependency lock files are unchanged from tested
source. Every frame's non-timing result matched exactly in all **9 final jobs**
against original runs, including fixed seeds, object IDs/points/scores/alerts,
timestamps and source alignment. All eight completed jobs in the preceding
0.25 CPU trial also matched. Clean/T1-A2 PNG/GIF replay and actual four-type smoke
(4 cells / 36 layer rows) passed after restore; smoke matched delivery results,
apart from measurement worker count and at most 1.12e-16 floating AUROC variation.

Final relevant suite: **21 passed in 68.22 s**, using restored real artifacts and a 30% user-scope CPU cap. It covers validation, bounded queue, ownership, byte-preserving results, actual clean/attack replay, fresh reset, actual timeout release, cooldown and delayed orphan cleanup. Shared detector code was not changed; artifact-generating training tests/full sweep were not run. A temporary isolated container with an empty model mount returned health 200 and readiness 503 with named missing paths, then was removed. Original mounted artifacts were not modified. Two application-only restart checks were executed; the first controller selected the wrong reference file and was corrected. The completed check recovered readiness in **9.50 s**, invalidated old sessions (401), rejected unsupported T3/A2 (400), completed a fresh 150-cycle clean replay exactly matching the original prefix, and reclaimed its aged crash output on the periodic sweep. Other container identities/restart counts/health states were unchanged. Final `doctor --full` passed.

## Cloudflare and browser validation

Host systemd `cloudflared.service` uses locally managed tunnel **rikon-home**,
UUID `9da48199-ab6f-4451-9e38-5df666fa6600`, config `/etc/cloudflared/config.yml`.
Only the demo hostname was added, first ingress rule:
`demo.rikon-karmakar.quest → http://127.0.0.1:8765`. Other existing hostnames,
the SSH route and final HTTP-404 catch-all were preserved. Original config backup:
`/etc/cloudflared/config.yml.bak.phantomguard.20261004T205100Z`.
Actual ingress validation and rule matching passed (demo rule 0, SSH rule 6,
unknown host final rule 8). Only demo DNS was routed to this tunnel. A temporary
overlapping connector kept the existing routes available during connector reload;
the service returned with four connections, then the temporary connector stopped.
Private credentials stayed out of Git and the report.

Public DNS resolves through the server's normal resolver; HTTPS `/healthz` and
`/readyz` return 200. Initial ISP negative caching required a temporary verified
browser resolver override; final validation uses normal DNS. Assets, catalog,
evaluation panel and private API were loaded by real headless Chromium 149,
in two independent contexts. Browser checks below are the synchronized post-restart checks. Earlier harness attempts could read the preceding clean result before the attack request began; those are excluded from browser success claims. The harness now waits for the accepted new job, verifies clean/attack request metadata and awaits reset before closing the browser.

Both synchronized post-restart browser checks **passed** locally and through normal public DNS/HTTPS. Each used two independent browser contexts, completed 150-cycle clean and actual T1/A2 jobs (verified request metadata), queued the second client, rejected cross-session reads (404), cancelled queued/running jobs, reset, stepped/sought, and played the attack output. T3/A0–A2 choices were disabled. Public clean had 0 alerting cycles; the T1/A2 prefix had 49 (3,348 object cycles). Artifact IDs/baselines matched, both result payloads transferred, and no page errors occurred. Public private responses were `Cache-Control: no-store` / `CF-Cache-Status: DYNAMIC` (127 successful private responses); assets/catalog/evaluation/readiness loaded successfully. Screenshots and response logs are in `browser-local-verified/` and `browser-public-verified/` under the ignored evidence directory. No browser access blocker remains. A supplementary Python-urllib health probe was rejected at Cloudflare with HTTP 403 / error 1010; curl GET and real browser requests passed. This is consistent with the existing [Browser Integrity Check](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/browser-integrity-check/) client-signature policy; no zone-wide security setting was changed. Use the documented curl checks for operations. A browser-facing deployment does not imply every automated user agent is accepted.

Final post-browser idle observation: **200 s / 41 samples**, no managed output files/directories, no worker retained, about **98 MiB warm container RAM**, no new OOM or automatic restart. Final local and public curl GET health/readiness all returned 200. All 20 pre-existing container identities and restart counts still matched the baseline. The measurement collector was stopped and its 128 MiB raw file saved under the ignored evidence directory.

## Exact operations

From the application root, with the already verified `.env.server`:

```bash
scripts/server-compose config
env COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT=1 scripts/server-compose build prototype
scripts/server-compose up -d --no-build prototype
scripts/server-compose ps
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8765/healthz
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8765/readyz
curl -fsS https://demo.rikon-karmakar.quest/readyz
scripts/server-compose logs --tail 100 prototype
scripts/server-compose restart prototype
scripts/server-compose stop prototype
```

Use `deploy/server.env.example` for a new local `.env.server`; select a unique
image tag when rebuilding. Update with `git fetch origin`, check out the
explicitly reviewed new commit, install the normal wheel if using native CLI,
then use the same serialized build/up/readiness commands. Reuse the immutable
bundle only while its artifact contracts remain compatible. Do not run builders.

Initial installation/restoration commands, run at the tested SHA in a clean
checkout (all actually performed here):

```bash
/home/lucifer/.local/bin/uv python install 3.11
/home/lucifer/.local/bin/uv venv --python 3.11 .venv
/home/lucifer/.local/bin/uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -r requirements/offline.lock
/home/lucifer/.local/bin/uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python --no-deps .
env PHANTOMGUARD_ROOT=/home/lucifer/projects/Hacksprint-2026/phantom-guard .venv/bin/python -m phantomguard init
.venv/bin/python -m phantomguard verify-bundle --archive ../phantomguard-c2cc251c6f4c.zip
.venv/bin/python -m phantomguard restore-bundle --archive ../phantomguard-c2cc251c6f4c.zip
.venv/bin/python -m phantomguard doctor --full
env OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 .venv/bin/python -m phantomguard replay --file onePersonMovingFrontAndBack.csv --cycles 150 --gif-cycles 40 --export --output-dir runs/smoke/clean
env OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 .venv/bin/python -m phantomguard replay --file onePersonMovingFrontAndBack.csv --attack T1 --level A2 --seed 11 --cycles 150 --gif-cycles 40 --export --output-dir runs/smoke/attack
env OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 .venv/bin/python -m phantomguard attack-eval --smoke --workers 1 --output-dir runs/smoke/evaluation
```

Archive size/hash must be compared to the trusted values above before generating
a missing sidecar or invoking restore. Restore preserves differing existing files;
use a fresh checkout if needed. Installing the offline lock uses pinned ordinary
package wheels; it does not train artifacts or imply an air-gapped installation.

Reproduce monitoring and load in separate background tool/terminal sessions:

```bash
python3 scripts/server-sample.py runs/server-validation/NEW/host-sampling 6000
python3 scripts/server-benchmark.py --samples runs/server-validation/NEW/host-sampling --out runs/server-validation/NEW --label repeat --seconds 120 --poll 1
.venv/bin/python scripts/server-browser-check.py --base https://demo.rikon-karmakar.quest --out runs/server-validation/NEW/browser --executable /home/lucifer/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium_headless_shell-1228/chrome-headless-shell-linux64/chrome-headless-shell --samples runs/server-validation/NEW/host-sampling
```

The sampler guard reports pressure; the workload controller cancels only its
Phantom Guard jobs. Stop the sampler by its recorded PID after collection.

Rollback the implementation while retaining thermal bounds:

```bash
env PHANTOMGUARD_IMAGE=phantomguard-server:c2cc251-before scripts/server-compose up -d --no-build prototype
```

That original code has no cooling setting. Exact original 1-CPU configuration is
saved at `runs/server-validation/20261004T204200Z/compose-before.yaml`:

```bash
docker compose --project-name phantomguard-server --env-file .env.server -f runs/server-validation/20261004T204200Z/compose-before.yaml up -d --no-build prototype
```

Its sustained load caused the observed high temperatures. Return to the validated
runtime with the normal wrapper `up -d --no-build prototype`. Tunnel rollback
restores the named config backup and reloads only cloudflared; deleting the demo
DNS route is optional when withdrawing this deployment. Preserve other DNS/routes.

## Git delivery

The server has no Git HTTPS push credentials. The authorized connected GitHub app publishes the same verified file tree to the fork branch `feature/server-deployment-tuning`, based on delivery commit `69c3b933`. GitHub-generated commit metadata gives that published commit a different SHA from the original local commits; the Git tree is compared exactly before advancing the new fork ref. The original local implementation and validation commits are retained on `feature/server-deployment-tuning-audit`. The running image still contains implementation `aefe8ac`; publication does not rebuild or replace it. The working deployment branch is aligned to the published identical tree, and no upstream merge or force-push was performed. [Fork review PR #1](https://github.com/Aurora-source/phantom-guard/pull/1) targets the verified delivery branch so its diff contains only these tuning changes. Creating the upstream PR returned HTTP 403, Resource not accessible by integration. The remaining Git delivery action is to open [the upstream compare form](https://github.com/Krishna-Gunjan/phantom-guard/compare/main...Aurora-source:feature/server-deployment-tuning?expand=1) in an authorized GitHub account and submit the PR (the fork PR preserves the complete description). The running validated service is independent of this permission blocker.

## Remaining detector and measurement limits

Published results remain visible: clean false alerts **1.42/min timeblock** and
**3.409/min LOSO**, exceeding the under-one target; **18 complete attacks evaded
detection**. T4 scene detection was about 48%/43%, exact-object identification
23%/20%. Green means unflagged, not authenticated. Resource tuning did not change
or rewrite these results. Unsupported T3/A0–A2 is a valid rejection.

This is recorded replay with simulated attacks, not live sensor ingestion.
Thermal caps trade throughput for shared-host headroom. No stable service-level
tail latency, all seeds/1,200-cycle combinations, or overnight thermal behavior
is claimed. No models/artifacts are missing; no upload is required.


# Staged runtime performance validation — 2026-10-05

This report covers a staged build at the common merged-PR #7 anchor and the then-current candidate branch. The existing public container/tunnel remained live during the local 8766 stage. No other services were stopped, rebuilt, or pruned. Raw 5 s samples, cgroup counters, sanitized request records, screenshots, build proof and machine inventory are in the ignored `runs/server-performance/20261005/` directory; it includes no credentials or session tokens.

## Host, prior state and artifacts

- Linux Ubuntu 26.04, kernel 7.0.0-28-generic; Intel i5-4200M, two physical/four logical CPUs; 10.6 GiB RAM, 4 GiB swap and about 66 GiB disk free during the candidate build. Docker 29.1.3, Compose 2.40.3. Inventory is `runs/server-performance/20261005/inventory-before.json`.
- 21 containers were up. The existing Phantom Guard container was healthy, ID `951436b551ee2bb22aaaf66716682e6e2bcb157c75e6b7c90a9d709e19bb3d91`; image ID `sha256:ea980f8c541d0ee381729e0c574b67ae34d2a65ce0f89f5c3b5d03acc0d393fb`. It has 2500/10000 CPU quota (0.25 logical CPU), 2 GiB memory and swap ceiling, 64 PIDs, read-only root/inputs/models, private `127.0.0.1:8765`, one worker, queue two, one numerical thread and 30 s cooling. No restarts/OOMs were observed. Host swap use was already about 1.9 GiB before the workload.
- Host-running systemd `cloudflared` was active; the locally managed `rikon-home` ingress validates and still maps `demo.rikon-karmakar.quest` to `http://127.0.0.1:8765`. No tunnel/DNS configuration was changed in the staged work.
- Bundle at `/home/lucifer/projects/Hacksprint-2026/phantomguard-c2cc251c6f4c.zip`: 10,319,138 bytes, SHA-256 `849dbd5c12410e75fd4d1ffc43aee45a7380756639548ac7d921dd7a65f90ad3`. Its 54 payload files match the manifest and all four restored recording hashes match the unchanged originals under `dataset/`. Candidate and prior service readiness both confirm AE ID `2ad682efc017e2cf96d856772b20db898edd6c1e253947b3df013a671f067115` and time-block baseline SHA-256 `b7f592bad60c25bfa4825c528cbb69d05b76239a5d2f500b755d41c933f82faf`. No artifact generation was run.

## Method

`server-sample.py` records host `/proc`, cgroup v2 usage/throttling/memory/OOM/PSI, disk counters, all Docker container health/restarts, output growth, existing service probe times, host swap rates and Intel core/package sensors every five seconds. It also samples host-running `cloudflared`. Docker CPU percentages are one-core units (100% = one logical CPU); host CPU is total over four logical CPUs. Container memory current/peak is actual resident cgroup memory, distinct from the 2 GiB configured ceiling. Sample counts and raw timestamps are retained.

The identical real API benchmark uses clean front/back 600 cycles seed 11, T1/A2 front/back 600 seed 11, T2/A4 chaotic 600 seed 22, T3/A4 chaotic 1000 seed 11 translated, and T4/A4 side-to-side 900 seed 33. It runs ordinary idle health/readiness/evaluation/catalog polling, one client, two independent clients, a short four-client queue/overload/cancel/reset burst, then recovery. Expected unsupported T3/A0–A2 is never counted as a failure. Fixed outputs are canonicalized without `processing_ms`; source bytes/timestamps and finalized labels remain separate from detection.

The before sampler has 223 rows from 06:49:17–07:09:35 UTC: idle 24 rows, one client 109, two clients 36, four-client burst 34, idle recovery 16. The workload completed all five one-client requests plus two-client clean and T1. The guarded four-client phase began but was stopped on a 180 s temperature mean of 80.0556°C at 07:05:05 UTC (instantaneous 76–78°C then, 7.0 GiB available RAM, zero swap-out); the benchmark deleted only its own sessions/jobs. This early stop is part of the evidence. The service stayed ready and all previously healthy existing containers remained up.

## Baseline results

| Stage | Host CPU mean | App CPU mean / peak (one-core %) | Actual app RAM mean / peak | Host available RAM | Swap-out | Temperature max / 180 s mean max |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Idle (24 samples) | 16.5% | 2.7 / 15.0 | 101 / 285 MiB | 6.78 GiB min | 0 MiB | 74 / 70°C |
| One client (109) | 19.7% | 20.3 / 25.2 | 202 / 319 MiB | 6.62 GiB min | 0 MiB | 78 / 72.8°C |
| Two clients (36; one pair) | 30.0% | 17.8 / 25.1 | 188 / 320 MiB | 6.67 GiB min | 0 MiB | 89 / 78.8°C |
| Four-client burst (34; aborted) | 18.9% | 5.2 / 25.0 | 127 / 320 MiB | 6.79 GiB min | 0 MiB | 80 / 80.3°C |
| Idle recovery (16) | 19.0% | 2.4 / 14.2 | 123 / 320 MiB | 6.82 GiB min | 0 MiB | 75 / 72.4°C |

One-client submission-to-result wall seconds: clean 26.72; T1 124.67; T2 122.52; T3 134.03; T4 132.20. Observed queue starts were 2.4 s clean and 29.3–29.8 s for later jobs, consistent with the configured cooldown and status polling. Two clients completed clean in 53.2 s (29.4 s observed queue) and T1 in 178.0 s (82.0 s observed queue). App status GET latency is summarized in `before/summary.json`; service latency/status and I/O distributions are in the same raw-derived report.

## Initial candidate checks (before the comparable workload)

- Built the real pinned Debian/Python 3.11 image locally as `phantomguard-server:performance-candidate`, image manifest `sha256:8888d4f883a9dce7444b6cfff56f1a5baad102afc9cd451609e77acc1ba3befa`. BuildKit transferred a 772 KiB context. It started only in isolated Compose project `phantomguard-performance-stage`, with `127.0.0.1:8766`, 0.25 CPU, 2 GiB/no extra swap, 64 PIDs and its own runs volume. Existing server image/container was not restarted.
- Startup artifact verification and `/healthz` `/readyz` passed; health was healthy, restart count zero, and the full verified runtime identity was `cb6d5e277c74af4ac18f47dc30d23292b66a8341681e0dd33c23dd53352ed877`. Startup full verification measured 4.49 s wall / 0.84 process CPU seconds. Repeated readiness used the identity cache.
- Effective container environment: server profile, worker 1, warm worker enabled, queue 2, cooldown 30 s, OPENBLAS/OMP/MKL each 1. Waitress parent had 10 threads; live replay child was observed with one thread, and cgroup PIDs remained below the limit. The minimal serving lock intentionally does not install `threadpoolctl`; no dependency was added for observing this.
- Candidate browser check at local port 8766 completed all five grouped checks with zero page errors and 121 private job responses: separate sessions/queueing/ownership, running and queued cancellation/reset, 150-cycle clean and fixed-seed T1/A2 replay, seek/playback, disabled unsupported choices, and `Cache-Control: no-store` without a cache hit.
- Candidate browser stage briefly peaked at 89°C, then had a rolling average near 80.1°C. The next benchmark was stopped before submission at 07:20:51 UTC by the existing 180 s >80°C guard; memory available was 6.78 GiB and swap-out zero. At that point the candidate had not completed a comparable busy benchmark. The candidate stayed healthy and the public hostname kept serving the original live container.

## Changes under evaluation

The API no longer reruns the full doctor on every job admission. Startup and changed file metadata force full doctor/content verification; a cheap metadata stamp runs on readiness/admission, with a periodic full check after 300 s. Read-only input/model/config mounts are required; config changes require a service restart so the in-memory config is never stale. Reports are cached by manifest/report-file stamps, individual/filter selection, up to 16 entries and 512 KiB per entry. Warm mode is explicit and opt-in outside the server profile. It reuses process-local decoded recording tuples and only the existing real-training immutable pools. A bounded adapter caps retained pools at 64 MiB/two variants and makes cached arrays/track collections read-only; content/config/code/file metadata changes clear them. Model, detector/tracker/fusion histories, RNG, attacker, labels and output lists are newly made for every job. Workers recycle at 16 jobs, post-job RSS 384 MiB, or idle TTL, and cancellation/deadline kills that worker.

True process CPU uses `process_time`; legacy detector/assembly `*_cpu_seconds` fields remain wall-clock intervals including scheduler/quota waits. The candidate also reports process CPU per real stage, scheduler queue age and estimated cooldown, without changing detector evidence or frame materialization.

## Operations and rollback

Use the branch worktree’s `scripts/server-compose` for every command. `.env.server` must be ignored/local, use absolute mounts for the already restored read-only raw/processed/models/config/reports, and keep the runs volume writable. Do not use the live checkout’s Compose files with this candidate; use the branch files and explicit project/env below.

```bash
APP=/home/lucifer/projects/Hacksprint-2026/phantom-guard-server-performance
export PHANTOMGUARD_SERVER_ENV="$APP/.env.promote"
export PHANTOMGUARD_COMPOSE_PROJECT=phantomguard-server
"$APP/scripts/server-compose" config
"$APP/scripts/server-compose" build --progress plain prototype
"$APP/scripts/server-compose" up -d --no-build prototype
"$APP/scripts/server-compose" ps
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8765/healthz
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8765/readyz
"$APP/scripts/server-compose" logs --tail 100 prototype
"$APP/scripts/server-compose" restart prototype
"$APP/scripts/server-compose" stop prototype
```

For isolated staging set `PHANTOMGUARD_SERVER_ENV="$APP/.env.stage"`, `PHANTOMGUARD_COMPOSE_PROJECT=phantomguard-performance-stage`, and port 8766 before using the same wrapper. Save an ignored backup of `.env.server` and the old image tag before promotion. Rollback sets `PHANTOMGUARD_IMAGE=phantomguard-server:thermal-tuned`, then runs the same `config` and `up -d --no-build prototype` commands. This changes only the Phantom Guard service; it does not restart the host or unrelated containers. Never prune images or shared Docker resources.

The original Docker image to retain is `phantomguard-server:c2cc251-before`, `sha256:f4ce6d3395f2764bca7887017eda5da1cfc07ff624ee1a5acbfbedf972738864`; prior thermal rollback image is `phantomguard-server:thermal-tuned`, `sha256:ea980f8c541d0ee381729e0c574b67ae34d2a65ce0f89f5c3b5d03acc0d393fb`.

The accepted detector limitations remain visible: clean alert targets remain unmet (time-block 1.42/min, LOSO 3.409), and 18 eligible completed runs fully evaded scene detection. Deployment changes do not modify those results. Comparable candidate workload and subsequent public/restart checks are recorded below.

## Completed comparable workload (16-job worker recycling)

The final candidate source is `9dd938cbde46343c1c0ac942006ebe2f112bbed4`; image `phantomguard-server:performance-9dd938c`, Docker image identity `sha256:fba909d2252e5aff4bbb3f38c357afe7210ffca1d57bafa4d36fa88ac4efca83` (image config `sha256:2451377ba91ad16ff8cd1f2aa54dbbfa7e4e4b446b8a9938b6cda43ef7d070ea`). The only later changes are measurement/tests/docs. The 188-sample benchmark interval starts at 07:50:18 UTC and contains 24 idle, 59 one-client, 39 two-client, 33 burst and 33 recovery samples. Its raw-derived summary is `after-tuned/summary.json`; raw samples were filtered by the actual workload interval, excluding the earlier build/interrupted idle attempt.

| Stage | Host CPU mean | App CPU mean (one-core %) | App RAM mean / lifetime cgroup peak MiB | Available RAM min GiB | Host swap-out MiB | Temp max / 180 s mean max °C |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Idle (24) | 27.82% | 2.02 | 28.8 / 41.8 | 6.70 | 7.95 | 88 / 77.7 |
| One client (59) | 20.51% | 15.98 | 184.1 / 276.1 | 6.57 | 8.22 | 81 / 78.2 |
| Two clients (39) | 20.06% | 11.53 | 256.4 / 287.2 | 6.52 | 0 | 80 / 73.9 |
| Four-client burst (33) | 18.50% | 8.74 | 127.2 / 287.2 | 6.55 | 0 | 78 / 73.1 |
| Recovery (33) | 17.71% | 2.31 | 140.5 / 287.2 | 6.70 | 0 | 78 / 71.7 |

The shared host had 16.18 MiB swap-out in early idle/one-client intervals, including a separate native doctor verification. It did not grow during two-client/burst/recovery; there were no OOMs or restarts. Host aggregate temperature/load/swap also includes unrelated workloads and local validation processes, so it cannot all be attributed to the application. The 180 s mean stayed below 80°C throughout this complete run. Memory and swap reserves were maintained. Thresholds were 2 GiB available, >10 MiB/s swap-out, new OOM, instantaneous >=95°C or a sustained 180 s temperature mean >80°C; only this task's jobs are canceled on a breach.

At the same quota/rest, one-client submission-to-result seconds were clean 25.23 (cold), T1 104.70 (first/cold pools), T2 48.04, T3 55.60 and T4 53.79. Active invocation wall/true process CPU seconds were respectively 17.21/4.02, 73.86/16.37, 17.53/3.86, 23.37/5.53 and 23.07/5.02 (values rounded; raw timings are authoritative). First T1 planning/materialization was 61.64 s wall; warm T2/T3/T4 planning was about 2–3 s. Cold spawn/input-identity verification precedes the invocation CPU timer; cgroup counters include it, and end-to-end timing includes it.

Two independent clients completed clean/T1 in 42.61/88.06 s, with observed queue waits 29.65/72.72 s. Warm T1 active work was 14.02 s versus about 88 s previously: about 6× lower active wall time. The next T2/T3 pair completed in 46.87/104.62 s. The warm expensive-attack active wall goal of 2× is met (T2–T4 about 4–5×); first cold preparation still remains. Removing cooldown or increasing quota was not used to obtain these gains. An initial eight-job recycler prematurely lost the warm cache before the next client pair; the measured 16-job boundary corrects that while retaining RSS/TTL/cancellation bounds.

Eleven jobs completed, none failed/timed out, and six queue overload responses occurred during two controlled bursts; accepted queued/running jobs were deleted and reset, and each recovery clean job succeeded. Every complete fixed-request detector output matched the prior deployment exactly after removing only `processing_ms`: all cycle/object/frame/track identities, timestamps, scores, reasons, flags and alerts are preserved. Raw comparison hashes are in `after-tuned/equivalence.json`. No detector frame was skipped. First usable output remains the complete immutable result.

Status GET median was 4.29 ms over 1,442 responses (before 6.03 ms/1,596). Result GET median was 125.51 ms/11 responses (before 128.98 ms/7); these include transfer/JSON decode in the benchmark client and are small-sample observations, not stable tail latency. Cgroup throttled wall time accumulated 173.5 s in one-client and 82.8 s in two-client stages; quotas still impose latency. Detector processing and physical assembly delay remain separate in each saved result; legacy CPU-named detector fields use wall clocks, while added process CPU clocks measure actual CPU.

Existing service probe statuses remained exactly at baseline (five services 200, the pre-existing portfolio route 404). Typical probe medians were 0.7–3.2 ms, with occasional 50–183 ms samples; no persistent degradation is established from these bounded samples. Host-running cloudflared used about 26.4 MiB RSS and 0.34/0.38% of one CPU in one/two-client stages (before ~26.7 MiB and 0.34/0.32%). No unrelated container identity/restart changes were made.

The numerical/thread policy test and thirteen runtime checks passed; the existing restored-data API/browser tests passed (21), followed by two actual deadline cases covering cold and warm workers. Deadline termination released the worker and cleaned the request. Native Python 3.11 doctor --full passed all five artifact/baseline sets. Desktop/Ryzen/Windows measurements remain for Workstream 2.

Across the complete candidate interval, the application cgroup had zero swap/OOM events, at most 15 PIDs (including temporary checks), and no restart; the configured memory ceiling itself did not reduce RSS. Warm idle recovery retained more RAM than the earlier process-per-job idle (140.5 versus 123 MiB mean), a measured cache tradeoff. The peaks and queue policy leave substantial host reserve.

The five full-stream probes (T1 seeds 11 and 22, T2/T3/T4) match exactly between the prior and candidate images: CAN bytes, ordered frame indices/timestamps, complete EOF labels CSV and sanitized scientific lifecycle sidecars. Raw hashes are in evidence-before.jsonl, evidence-after.jsonl and stream-equivalence.json. No detector labels were read or leaked. For the identical five-request one-client stage, directly measured cgroup CPU deltas were 109.106 core-seconds over a 539.578 s sampled interval before, versus 45.752 core-seconds over 285.947 s after (2.38× less actual aggregate application CPU). Intervals run from first to last five-second sample and omit their boundary fractions; they include API/health activity, not only detector CPU.

## Promotion and public browser observation

Only the production Phantom Guard service was replaced, using the same private origin port, artifact mounts, Docker network/runs volume and unchanged Cloudflare ingress. Local/public readiness and verified HTTPS returned 200; runtime identity matches staged verification. The stage container is stopped and rollback tags/env are retained. A strict public-browser check confirmed separate clients/owner 404 but exposed an existing frontend reset/poll race: a delayed status 404 after DELETE can overwrite the reset message. Backend removal succeeds; Workstream 3 owns the required generation guards on awaited status/result and catch/finally UI updates. This observed failure is retained under public-browser/browser-events.json and documented in the interface handoff; it is not hidden by changing job access controls.

The repeated strict public Chromium check passed all five grouped checks with zero page errors and 94 private responses: assets/readiness, two independent sessions, owner 404, queued/running cancel/reset, clean and T1/A2 playback/step/seek and unsupported choices. All private responses were no-store and Cloudflare DYNAMIC, never HIT. The prior intermittent reset-message race remains disclosed for Workstream 3; a passing repeat does not erase it.

The production application alone was deliberately restarted, regained local/public readiness (HTTP 200/TLS verified), and fresh public-browser clean plus T1/A2 150-cycle runs and stepping passed with no page errors. Docker reports healthy and zero automatic restarts. Initial post-restart harness sequencing was corrected to wait for the new POST/start state rather than mistake the prior Complete text for a new result; the successful evidence is post-restart-browser/checks.json. One young 51-byte status directory from the interrupted harness was retained within the configured 600 s orphan TTL and then automatically removed during observed idle expiry. The live browser output directory is empty after cleanup. No orphan active worker from that request survives the container restart.

Fork branch publication succeeded. Upstream PR creation returned GitHub integration HTTP 403, Resource not accessible by integration; no PR was created. Exact title/body and compare/create link are saved in docs/parallel/server-pr.md. The service is deployed independently of that GitHub permission. Workstream 2/3 integration and the frontend generation-guard correction await their completed reviewed branches/handoffs; no trained artifact upload is needed for this runtime release.

Measured one-client timing detail (seconds unless marked; loading/planning include their I/O and quota waits):

| Request | Queue observed | Input load wall | Plan/full materialization wall | Detect + display wall / true CPU | Detector processing p99 ms (wall) | Physical assembly p99 ms | API end-to-end |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Clean | 0.67 | 4.45 | 0.00 | 11.18 / 2.55 | 59.25 | 33.60 | 25.23 |
| T1 | 29.80 | 0.01 | 61.64 | 11.94 / 2.74 | 49.35 | 33.60 | 104.70 |
| T2 | 29.29 | 0.00 | 2.86 | 14.37 / 3.08 | 79.53 | 33.60 | 48.04 |
| T3 | 29.61 | 0.00 | 2.41 | 20.49 / 4.84 | 39.33 | 33.60 | 55.60 |
| T4 | 29.29 | 0.01 | 5.41 | 17.29 / 4.04 | 48.86 | 33.50 | 53.79 |

The detector processing p99 excludes attacker preparation and browser rendering and is still wall time under the quota. Assembly delay is elapsed sensor ticks converted with the documented assumed tick duration; it is not CPU. Detect + display includes result object construction and per-25-cycle progress I/O. Exact JSON serialization/write, network delivery and polling are outside those stage fields; saved result GET latency and full API time include their respective work. A stage with total input loading near zero benefits from the existing immutable parser cache.

Promotion/public/restart monitoring captured 180 five-second samples, peak 89°C and maximum 180 s temperature mean 78.0°C. This includes headless Chromium running locally on the server as a test client; its rendering CPU is host validation overhead and would ordinarily run on the visitor's computer. No unrelated container ID/restart change occurred relative to the initial inventory. Additional idle sampling is in recovery-host/; no overnight stability or larger public capacity is claimed. Effective merged development Compose was also verified: four adjustable CPUs, 4 GiB, two browser workers and zero cooldown, without the home-server fractional quota.

Final idle recovery at about 08:29 UTC showed 66°C core/package temperature, zero swap-out, 6.55 GiB available RAM and about 194.5 MiB app cgroup memory after warm full-pool replay. This is higher idle RAM than the pre-cache process-per-job service, but safely below the measured peak and deliberate worker budget. Output/storage returned to zero after job reset and orphan TTL expiry. All existing health statuses remained at baseline.
