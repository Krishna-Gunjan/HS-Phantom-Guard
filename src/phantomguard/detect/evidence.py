"""Additive per-reason evidence records (schema 1).

An evidence record explains *why* one reason code fired, using only observed input and frozen
calibration. It is JSON-compatible (plain dicts of numbers/strings/lists) so it can ride along
with existing verdict exports. It never carries a probability: ``normalized`` is a residual in
units of the calibrated scale, and ``support`` states how much clean data stood behind the bound.

Evidence localises a suspicious frame, object, track or scene as far as its scope supports. It
cannot identify a human attacker, authenticate a sensor or prove physical reality. A forgery
that is observationally indistinguishable in every available field stays unflagged.
