"""Episode-level calibration of the v2 soft rules from OUT-OF-RECORDING clean data.

Marginal per-window percentiles do not control persistent alert episodes per minute: one object can
exceed on many overlapping windows (temporal dependence) and many objects/rules multiply the chances.
This module therefore counts *episodes* (non-alert -> alert transitions per track, after fusion) on
clean recordings that were NOT used to fit the model that scores them (inner leave-one-recording-out
CV over the permitted train/validation recordings). Each tunable rule gets the least sensitive
threshold at which the rule alone produces no more than its allowance of episodes there.

Limits that every report must repeat: a handful of minutes of clean data from one session; episodes
within a recording are correlated; recordings are consecutive segments of one session, so nothing here
is an IID or distribution-free guarantee, and new independent sessions are the real test.
