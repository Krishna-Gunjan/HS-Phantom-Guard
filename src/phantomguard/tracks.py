    """Links objects to tracks by slot across consecutive cycles.

    A slot continues its track if it was seen within the last ``max_gap_cycles + 1`` cycles (the
    sensor often drops a slot for one cycle) and its position moved by at most ``reassign_jump``; otherwise a new track is born (``born_by_jump`` when the slot was
    present but jumped).

    ``predictive_gate`` (config ``tracks.predictive_gate``, default off) measures the jump against the
    nearer of the last position and the position predicted from the last reported velocity over the
    elapsed time. It is conservative: it can only keep a link the plain gate would cut (a fast mover
    across a dropped cycle), never cut one it keeps. On the four recordings it changes 4 of ~433k links,
    so it is off by default; training, attacker pools and the detector must use the same setting.
    Links within ``ambiguity`` (fractions of the jump threshold) of the gate are marked ambiguous so a
    reset or continuation that could have gone the other way is visible in evidence.
